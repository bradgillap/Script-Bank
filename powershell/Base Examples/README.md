# Base Examples
Powershell examples for quickly pulling core concepts into your scripts. The goal of this section is to show the language in quick easily digestible pieces depending on the subject.

## Script-Bank
The script bank is a place to store useful scripts. Idea shamelessly stolen from Ryan Morris. The difference is that the Script-Bank
is better organized with scripts from many places while [Ryans Script-Depot](https://github.com/hackmods/Script-Depot) is mostly things
we have developed ourselves. All license information and attributions should be included inside each script.
## Usage
As scripts don't often fall out of date, this should be useful for a long time but do check the time stamps of when each file was updated. 

## Contributing
1. Fork it!
2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request :D
6. Don't steal code and follow whatever license guidelines for attribution or sharing.
